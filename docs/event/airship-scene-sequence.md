# City airship scene sequence

Recovered `DftSrt.eventDeparture` calls
`startFadeOutCutSceneDefault`, then `startNQCutScene(departure, 1)`, then
`startNQCutScene(arrival, 1)` when an arrival key is present, and finally
`startFadeInCutSceneAfterWarp`. The calls are ordered in the client script;
the method itself does not encode a six-route table or world landing XYZ.
`DirectorBaseClass.delegateEvent` forwards the invoking owner after the
player argument when it calls the delegated method. This is why the scene
keys are the later arguments to `DftSrt.eventDeparture`, rather than fields
on a `PopulaceFlyingShip` actor.

The installed scene assets have city-specific departure (`*000`) and arrival
(`*010`) names. Their byte identities were checked directly:

The contributor's scene inventory parses actor dictionaries and cutscene
transforms from these assets. Those transforms are cinematic placements,
not authenticated public-zone spawns or arrival coordinates. A current
server route's choice of a departure/arrival pair is an implementation
decision unless joined to retail route evidence; asset presence alone does
not authenticate that choice.

Provenance: recovered
`quest/scenario/defaulttalk/dftsrt.lua:eventDeparture`,
`director/directorbaseclass.lua:delegateEvent`, and
`quest/questbaseclass_common.lua:startNQCutScene` establish the script
sequence. Installed `client/cut/zep0*/zep0*` files supply the six sizes and
hashes; `tools/outputs/lpb/airship_decomp_20260824/scene_inventory.csv`
records their parsed roles and dictionaries. No retail runtime probe or
new capture was used.
