# GTEX and PWIB loader fields

This page records the fields consumed by the retail 1.23b client loaders for
standalone GTEX and PWIB resources. The reviewed `ffxivgame.exe` has SHA-256
`9341f2b4567440b310a4d494f5cc5599ca334ba51c8042247317ff466492f2e9`.
All multibyte resource fields below are big-endian.

## GTEX

The dispatcher at `0x004323d0` selects the GTEX loader at `0x00431f30` after
checking the `GTEX` signature. The loader consumes this header surface:

| Offset | Width | Loader-backed meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `+0x06` | 1 | Client texture-format table index |
| `+0x07` | 1 | Mip level count |
| `+0x09` | 1 | Texture flags |
| `+0x0a` | 2 | Width |
| `+0x0c` | 2 | Height |
| `+0x0e` | 2 | Depth |
| `+0x10` | 4 | Optional surface-offset table base, relative to the blob |
| `+0x14` | 4 | Source-data base, relative to the blob |

Flag bit 0 selects a cube texture, otherwise bit 1 selects a volume texture,
otherwise the object is a 2D texture. When both type bits are set, the cube
branch wins. Bit 2 changes one creation argument to 4; its higher-level meaning
is not established.

The constructors at `0x00418bf0`, `0x00418d00`, and `0x00418e00` retain the
fields. The creation path at `0x004312d0` passes width, height, depth, mip count,
and the table-selected D3D format to `D3DXCreateTexture`,
`D3DXCreateCubeTexture`, or `D3DXCreateVolumeTexture` as appropriate.

When the offset-table base is nonzero, `0x00432500` selects one eight-byte
entry per face and mip level and reads its first big-endian dword as a
per-surface offset. It returns:

```text
blob + source-data base + per-surface offset
```

The upload loop at `0x00431e20` passes that result through `0x00431080` to a
D3DX load-from-memory call. This makes `+0x14`, not `+0x1c`, the proven data
boundary. No function in the reproduced loader path reads `+0x1c`, so it has
no promoted extent meaning.

A header-only census of 21,161 retail GTEX resources found every `+0x14` value
within its file, with no zero values. The observed bases were 32, 48, 64, and
96 bytes; 48 occurred 11,272 times, 32 occurred 6,974 times, 64 occurred 2,914
times, and 96 occurred once. The census corroborates the loader field but does
not narrow the format to those four values.

## PWIB

PWIB is a split container. The streaming loader at `0x004ea560` reads and
byte-swaps four header dwords. Its three boundary fields are:

| Offset | Width | Loader-backed meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `+0x04` | 4 | Total size and second-segment end |
| `+0x08` | 4 | First-segment offset |
| `+0x0c` | 4 | Second-segment offset |

The exact segment spans are therefore:

```text
first  = [field(+0x08), field(+0x0c))
second = [field(+0x0c), field(+0x04))
```

Helpers `0x004ebed0` and `0x004ebf00` compute those two lengths. The streaming
path supplies them independently to `0x004e8bf0` and `0x004e8ca0`, then reads
both allocations through `0x004e8b90`.

The resource consumer at `0x00a642f0` maps both spans with the same boundary
arithmetic and requires an `SEDB` signature at the first-segment offset. It
does not establish that the first segment is a complete standalone SEDB file.
The purpose of the second segment remains unresolved. Consequently PWIB must
not be modeled as an unbounded 16-byte prefix followed by an ordinary nested
SEDB extent.

A header-only census of 3,544 retail PWIB resources found no unordered
boundaries, total-size mismatches, or missing `SEDB` signatures at the first
offset. The first offset was 16 in every observed file. First-segment lengths
ranged from 96 to 4,486,464 bytes and second-segment lengths from 376 to
5,592,404 bytes. Those retail observations corroborate the general loader
arithmetic without replacing it with fixed constants.

## Evidence boundary

The GTEX claim is reproduced from the functions above plus format helpers
`0x00431710`, `0x00433300`, and `0x00433240`. Tracked Rosetta sources preserve
the dispatcher, loader, three texture constructors, and upload-loop bodies
under `src/ffxivgame/_rosetta/`.

The PWIB claim uses the streaming path, exact length helpers, request helpers,
and resource consumer listed above. `0x004e8bf0`, `0x004e8ca0`, and
`0x004e8b90` corroborate allocation and read sequencing but add no field
meaning. Caller `0x007cbd50` adds context only and is not required for the
layout verdict.

This finding establishes static loader arithmetic for the exact retail build.
It does not name the GTEX format-table values, assign a semantic name to GTEX
flag bit 2 or header `+0x1c`, explain PWIB's second segment, or establish
cross-build stability.
