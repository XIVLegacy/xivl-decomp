# Limsa rain DrawEnv and VFX inputs

The resource selected for supplied Limsa region key `101` and weather `8007`
contains typed DrawEnv definitions and a referenced `vfx_cam_rain` definition.
The checked native paths blend name-matched DrawEnv work and submit two VFX
aliases through an initialization descriptor. These are conditional static
contracts: they do not establish a rendered retail rain effect.

The [weather transition finding](../net/weather-transition-runtime.md#limsa-rain-selection)
owns the packet, region lookup and queue route to resource `0x29D90013`.
This page follows that resource's presentation inputs.

## Inputs and method

| Input | Identity |
| --- | --- |
| Retail executable | FFXIV 1.23b `ffxivgame.exe`, 15,996,808 bytes, image base `0x00400000` |
| Executable SHA-256 | `9341f2b4567440b310a4d494f5cc5599ca334ba51c8042247317ff466492f2e9` |
| Selected resource | `data/29/D9/00/13.DAT`, 113,024 bytes |
| Resource SHA-256 | `11b2735ee161d302ad212a27041c84060a5b4f61da438c15c9f4bec982d83012` |

Native locators below are VAs in that executable. Retained Ghidra instruction
listings were checked instruction by instruction against the original PE
using pefile `2024.8.26` and Capstone `5.0.7`, x86-32 mode. Python `struct`
and `hashlib` checked the resource framing, typed records, pointers, strings
and dependency rows. These observations used preserved files without client
execution.

The DAT's outer header dword at file `0x20` selects the `SEDBlyb` at
`0x5E0`; its header length at `0x5EE` is `0x30`. Embedded LYB offsets
therefore add `0x610` to obtain file offsets. The LYB node-type table gives
record extents, sizes and reference-field descriptors; the class reference
at object `+4` identifies the class descriptor. The generic
[typed-wrapper creation path](bgchip-model-binding.md) describes the separate
native loading and creation contracts.

## Authored DrawEnv and rain definitions

The selected LYB contains these `0x3C`-byte records of class ID `0x0DA4`,
path `DrawEnvObjects/DrawEnv/DrawEnvObject`:

| Name | LYB offset | File offset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dwev_sky` | `0x6058` | `0x6668` |
| `dwev_cld` | `0x6094` | `0x66A4` |
| `dwev_00` | `0x60D0` | `0x66E0` |
| `dwev_10` | `0x610C` | `0x671C` |
| `dwev_20` | `0x6148` | `0x6758` |
| `dwev_11` | `0x6184` | `0x6794` |
| `dwev_21` | `0x61C0` | `0x67D0` |
| `dwev_12` | `0x61FC` | `0x680C` |
| `dwev_22` | `0x6238` | `0x6848` |
| `dwev_13` | `0x6274` | `0x6884` |

Their class descriptor is at LYB `0x4348`, file `0x4958`. This typed
inventory does not identify which spatial or timeline lane is active.

The `InstanceObject` named `cbind_rain` is at LYB `0x5D80`, file `0x6390`.
Its definition-reference field `+0x3C` contains `0x83A0`, selecting the
`0x28`-byte `vfx_cam_rain` definition at file `0x89B0`. That definition's
class descriptor at LYB `0x449C`, file `0x4AAC`, has class ID `0x0A5D`
and path `BaseObjects/VFX/VFXBaseObject`. This is an explicit typed
reference, beyond a rain-related string occurrence.

The definition's alias pointers match outer dependency rows. Each outer row
is `0x20` bytes: alias at `+0`, raw four-byte tag at `+0x10`, numeric key at
`+0x14`. These tags are recorded as stored ASCII bytes.

| Definition field | Alias | Dependency row file offset | Raw tag | Resource key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `+0x18` | `1ipGk6vleafinst` | `0x460` | `sniv` | `0x898C0011` |
| `+0x1C` | `2Dn7c7cam_rain` | `0x440` | `fael` | `0x898B0002` |
| `+0x20` | `2UXnSGrain0001s` | `0x420` | `ffev` | `0x898D0054` |

The first alias/key also occurs at outer row `0x5C0` in the cloud group.
The resource separately contains `vfx_cloud` at LYB `0x83C8`, file `0x89D8`.
The `cbind_rain` and `vfx_cam_rain` names alone do not prove camera binding.

## Conditional DrawEnv blend contract

Let R be a complete MapLayoutWeather resource and O the weather owner used
in the [provider and queue path](../net/weather-transition-runtime.md#layout-providers-and-environment-receivers).
Constructor `0x0083C970` installs primary table `0x0103D0BC` and the
complete-object `+4` interface table `0x0103CEC4`. Primary slot 19 selects
`0x0083C110`, which calls `0x0083BE80` at `0x0083C1D7`.

`0x0083BE80` rebuilds R+`0x3D0`. Its interface slot-104 call at
`0x0083BEC2` resolves to `0x00657680` in the constructed table. That
getter reads interface `+0xCC`, complete R+`0xD0`. The caller adjusts a
nonnull returned interface by minus four and enumerates through
`0x00A75460/0x00A75470/0x00A75490/0x00A754B0`.
For each returned layout interface, it calls slot 40 at `0x0083BF38` and
builds a name-keyed entry using the returned work pointer and copied work
buffers (`0x0083BBE0`, calls at `0x0083BF50..0x0083BF6E`).

On default LayoutDrawEnvObject interface table `0x0109FD44`, slot 40 is
`0x00C4BAE0`. It returns interface `+0x14`; the complete-object locator
at `0x0118AAC0` records interface offset four in its `+4` field, so this
is complete object `+0x18`. The diagnostic-anchored
[DrawEnv initialization finding](draw-env-texture-binding-boundary.md#caller-observations)
owns that work-pointer setup. The checked path does not establish the
selected DAT's population of R+`0xD0` or prove that all ten authored
definitions enter the collection.

The continuing blend branch uses the following contracts:

| Locator | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| `0x007E78D0 -> 0x007E6690`, call `0x007E7A25` | Supplies newest and oldest queue resources plus the weather fraction. Queue retirement and readiness substitution follow the existing weather finding. A pair can refer to the same resource. |
| `0x007E66EE..0x007E6711` | Obtains each complete resource's DrawEnv tree through `0x0083A740`, which returns resource `+0x3D0`, then calls `0x007E65A0` with destination O+`0x20`, new tree, old tree, fraction and the separate fourth input of `0x007E6690`. |
| `0x007E665D` | Calls `0x007EB8A0` with destination, new tree, old tree and fraction. Its name comparisons select matching source entries; a missing match skips that blend. |
| `0x007EBA59/0x007EBA76/0x007EBA93` | Passes work pointers from tree-node `+0x64/+0x68/+0x6C` to `0x008CB340`, with the fraction and mode zero. That wrapper forwards to `0x008CB080`. |
| `0x008CB0D1..0x008CB0FB` | Compares data counts through `0x00C1F380`; incompatible counts return before the interpolation body. |
| `0x008CB111..0x008CB1C0`; `0x008CB24C/0x008CB27C/0x008CB2C4/0x008CB30C` | Interpolates scalar components and calls the four-float helper `0x007E9E40`. The helper's `SUBPS/MULPS/ADDPS` at `0x007E9EB0/0x007E9EFB/0x007E9F38` compute `old + fraction * (new - old)`. Field semantics and units remain unassigned. |

The later call at `0x007E6675` enters `0x007E6460`, whose independent
[spatial fade](../net/weather-transition-runtime.md#independent-spatial-fade)
is distinct from the packet fraction. ScreenEnv uses resource `+0x3DC`
through `0x0083A750` and its separate branch in `0x007E6690`.
These DrawEnv interpolation instructions do not establish a rain emission
rate or particle-opacity formula.

## Conditional VFX alias consumer

Creator table `0x0103C574` supplies kind `0x0F` through slot 5
`0x00AA7180`. Its slot-6 matcher `0x00AA71E0` accepts the class ID in
cell `0x010A2CD8`, `0x0A5D`. Slot 1 `0x00839F50` constructs through
`0x008D4EF0` and returns complete object `+4`, whose table is
`0x010622B4`. This is a matching native creator contract, conditional on
registration, the [creation policy](../net/weather-transition-runtime.md#creation-policy-inputs),
manager admission and successful loading.

The [generic creation path](bgchip-model-binding.md) attaches a definition
through interface slot 7 before later initialization. Here slot 7
`0x008D5440 -> 0x00AA89A0` stores that pointer at interface `+4`;
slot 8 `0x008D5570` returns it. Slots 42/43 in this table are
`0x00AB4F10/0x00AB4F60`: both call slot 8, then return the attached
definition's `+0x18/+0x1C`. For the selected rain definition those are
the `leafinst` and `cam_rain` aliases in the table above.

Slot 9, `0x00AB5150`, requires its supplied context's `+4` pointer to be
nonnull. Calls at `0x00AB5184/0x00AB5192` obtain those two aliases.
The slot-26 calls at `0x00AB51E6/0x00AB51F9` use selectors 0 and 1;
`0x00AB4E90` returns type words from `0x010A2028/0x010A2024`, respectively
`0x76696E73/0x6C656166`. Their little-endian bytes match raw tags
`sniv/fael`. The initializer pairs these words with the two aliases in
the descriptor's input storage and passes the descriptor's address to
context `+4`'s virtual slot 1 at `0x00AB5273`.

This joins two selected serialized alias fields to a concrete native
descriptor-submission call. It does not resolve that context interface's
implementation or the resulting effect. The definition's `+0x20` alias is
an authored dependency here; this initializer's two getters do not consume
that field. No inspected path joined these VFX inputs to the DrawEnv blend
fraction.

## Remaining boundary

The preserved artifacts establish the selected resource's typed rain
reference, the conditional DrawEnv interpolation contract, and the VFX alias
descriptor handoff. They leave these specific joins unresolved:

- The selected DAT's admitted DrawEnv objects and their population of the
  manager returned from complete resource `+0xD0`.
- The concrete context `+4` receiver at `0x00AB5273`, including its resource
  resolution and effect-creation behavior.
- The `cbind_rain` instance's attachment/activation and the selected timeline
  or spatial lane, followed by any emitter or renderer submission.

Neither authored names nor the arithmetic above establish visible rain,
camera following, particle density, opacity, a common fade duration, or GPU
submission. Those claims require the missing native joins; this finding
does not substitute an assumed rain-effect implementation for them.
